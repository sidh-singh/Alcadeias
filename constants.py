# ─── Price Data Feed ───
# Main OHLC candle feed pulled each loop. This previously fed the SHA entry
# indicator (removed in the RSI+MACD rebuild); it is retained for market-liveness
# / metadata and as a price source. The RSI+MACD slope entry runs on its own
# H1/H4 fetches (added in a later step), independent of this feed.
CANDLE_TIMEFRAME = 'TIMEFRAME_M15'   # Timeframe for the main price feed (resolved via mt5 at runtime)
CANDLE_COUNT = 300
ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_TICK_BAR = True     # Append provisional bar from tick when MT5 bar feed lags (M1 only)

# ─── Market Status ───
MARKET_STATUS_TIMEFRAME = 'TIMEFRAME_M1'   # Timeframe used to check market open/closed
MARKET_LOOKBACK_MINUTES = 3                # Max minutes since last candle → still "open"

# ─── Strategy Parameters ───
STRATEGY_HEDGE = 1                  # Hedge / profit target multiplier
FIBO_SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 25           # Fibonacci sequence length (first 2 dropped)

# ─── RSI Indicator ───
RSI_LENGTH = 14                     # RSI period
RSI_MA_TYPE = 'RMA'                 # MA type for RSI smoothing (RMA = Wilder's, matches TradingView default)
# RSI(14) converges within a few hundred bars, so multi-timeframe RSI fetches use
# this smaller count instead of the large SHA CANDLE_COUNT. This avoids pulling
# years of history on high timeframes (e.g. 8000 H6 bars ≈ 5.5 years) every loop.
RSI_CANDLE_COUNT = 500

# ─── RSI fetch timeframes (for the dashboard RSI display; entry filter removed) ───
RSI_MTF_TIMEFRAMES = ['TIMEFRAME_M1', 'TIMEFRAME_M5', 'TIMEFRAME_M15', 'TIMEFRAME_M30']

# ─── RSI DCA Ladder Timeframes ───
# Tiered DCA (BUY_MORE / SELL_MORE) is gated by these timeframes' RSI — one
# timeframe per open-position count. Position 1 is the initial entry; each
# further position is added when the matching timeframe RSI hits its extreme:
#   count 1 → M1, count 2 → M5, count 3 → M15, count 4 → H1, count 5 → H4.
# After the last ladder position the basket is force-closed on the final-close
# timeframe RSI (see below).
RSI_DCA_LADDER_TIMEFRAMES = [
    'TIMEFRAME_M1', 'TIMEFRAME_M5', 'TIMEFRAME_M15', 'TIMEFRAME_H1', 'TIMEFRAME_H4',
]

# ─── RSI Final Forced-Close Timeframe ───
# When a basket has maxed out its DCA ladder, the final forced close is
# triggered by this timeframe's RSI hitting the oversold/overbought threshold.
# Previously the 1-hour (H1) RSI was used; now the 6-hour (H6) RSI.
RSI_FINAL_CLOSE_TIMEFRAME = 'TIMEFRAME_H6'

# ─── MACD Indicator (RSI+MACD slope entry engine) ───
MACD_FAST = 12                      # fast EMA length (TradingView ta.macd default)
MACD_SLOW = 26                      # slow EMA length
MACD_SIGNAL = 9                     # signal EMA length

# ─── Slope Entry/Exit Engine (H1 + H4 RSI & MACD-histogram slopes) ───
SLOPE_TIMEFRAMES = ['TIMEFRAME_H1', 'TIMEFRAME_H4']   # direction decided on H1 and H4
PEAK_LOOKBACK = 20                  # candles scanned for the latest pivot (configurable)

HISTORICAL_SUMMARY_DAYS = 3650                  # Days of deal history (≈ 10 years)
HISTORICAL_SUMMARY_FILENAME = 'historical_summary.json'

# ─── Dashboard ───
DASHBOARD_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 5000   # Auto-refresh interval in milliseconds
DASHBOARD_HOST = '0.0.0.0'
DASHBOARD_PORT = 8050
DASHBOARD_MAX_HEIGHT_JSON = 300     # Max-height (px) for raw JSON viewer

# ─── Daily Trade Graph ───
GRAPH_TEXT_LABEL_THRESHOLD = 60     # Hide per-bar text labels when deal count exceeds this
GRAPH_CUM_LABEL_THRESHOLD = 60     # Hide cumulative line labels when deal count exceeds this

# ─── Order Execution ───
ORDER_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 1                       # Mandatory sleep after placing an order (lets MT5 update positions)

# ─── Strategy Log ───
STRATEGY_LOG_FILENAME = 'strategy_log.json'     # Log file name inside OUTPUT_DIR
STRATEGY_LOG_MAX_ENTRIES = 200                   # Max log entries kept per symbol

# ─── Active Config (Dashboard ↔ Bot) ───
ACTIVE_CONFIG_FILENAME = 'active_config.json'   # Dashboard writes, bot reads on startup
